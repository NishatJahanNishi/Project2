				<h1>Music for your Health</h1>
<p  align="center"><img src="img/pic8.png" ></p>

<p>Human beings are innately musical. Our biology demands it. Every human heart beats in its own unique rhythm. The accent patterns of our speech identify us city folk from South Boston or Midwestern farmers from South Dakota. Scientists are convinced that the recognition of specific “danger” sounds (a baby’s cry, a woman’s scream, a saber-toothed tiger’s growl) has had great survival value for our species. Given the evolutionary pressure to develop a keen sense of hearing, it is not surprising that over millions of years, we humans have also developed our own sonic language that transcends the function of human speech. Our creation of sound for sound’s sake is called “music.”</p>
<p>Thus, music is an art form that defines our species from the dawn of pre-history. It continues to have near-magical powers over human behavior to this day. If you don’t believe this, just go with your pre-teen daughter to a Justin Bieber concert. Music’s healing properties have been suspected since the first tribal shaman shook a gourd over the death bed of a fallen warrior. Despite this long-standing healing history, modern medicine has been slow to adopt music as an important tool of the healing arts. Nevertheless, modern medicine is slowly changing.</p>
 
<p>Dr. Gottfried Schlaug, a Harvard University neurologist, thinks music provides an alternate entry point to the brain, bypassing portions that are blocked by injury or disease. Various aspects of music engage many regions of the brain that are also devoted to speech, movement, and social interaction. Dr. Schlaug suggests that if disease or trauma has disabled a part of the brain needed for these human activities, music can sometimes get in through a “back door” and restore function through an alternate route, teaching the brain “new tricks.”</p>
<p>Dr. Claudius Conrad at Harvard Medical School is a gifted pianist and a lead investigator in a study looking at the effects of music on the sleep patterns of critically ill patients. He notes that “research has already shown that if you play a classical piece of music — like Mozart — at a certain slow beat, the listener will adapt their heart beat to the beat of the music.” At the University of Munich, Dr. Conrad was able to show that critically ill patients required fewer sedative drugs when they listened to one hour of Mozart. As expected, the patients’ blood pressures and heart rates became more stable while they listened to the music. But patients also had a 50 percent spike in pituitary [pih-TWO-ih-tear-ee] growth hormone, which can stimulate healing. Dr. Conrad now asks his patients (or their families) what music they’d like to hear before he begins surgery;
 if neither can provide an answer, he usually plays Mozart.</p>
<p>In summary, enjoying music is a uniquely human trait that makes our lives better and contributes to brain health. Our ancestors have used music and rhythmic sound as healing tools for over 50,000 years. Given this fact, it is ironic that modern physicians should only recently have rediscovered the healing power of music.</p>
<p>Dr. R. Mack Harrell’s life is centered around sound. By day, in his Fort Lauderdale, Florida endocrinology practice, he uses sound above the range of human hearing (high resolution ultrasound) to locate tiny parathyroid and thyroid tumors in patients preparing for minimally invasive endocrine surgery.
 By night, in his music studio in Boca Raton,
 he creates sonic experiences (songs) for the pop and country markets and is actively pursuing his first Nashville cut.</p><br />
